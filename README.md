# Elevator Algorithm Simulator

An interactive web-based simulator for experimenting with and visualizing different elevator scheduling algorithms.

## Overview

This simulator allows users to explore and understand various elevator scheduling algorithms through a visual and interactive interface. Users can customize parameters, observe real-time elevator operations, and analyze performance metrics of different algorithms.

## Features

### Building Configuration
- Adjustable number of floors (5-20)
- Multiple elevators (1-4)
- Customizable building parameters

### Passenger System
- Dynamic passenger generation
- Individual passenger properties:
  - Starting floor
  - Destination floor
  - Weight
- Visual representation of waiting and riding passengers

### Elevator Properties
- Maximum capacity (weight and passengers)
- Real-time load status
- Movement direction indicators
- Configurable speed and door timing

### Algorithm Support
Built-in algorithms include:
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Nearest Car Algorithm
- SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
- LOOK Algorithm

Custom algorithm interface available for implementing new strategies.

### Visualization
- Real-time animations
- Interactive controls
- Status indicators
- Load visualization

### Analytics
- Real-time performance metrics:
  - Average waiting time
  - Average journey time
  - Total passengers served
  - Energy consumption
- Algorithm comparison tools
- Performance history
